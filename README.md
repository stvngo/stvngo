## Hi, I’m Steven!

Welcome to my GitHub!  

- I’m currently double majoring in **Data Science** and **Mathematics and Computer Science** at **UC San Diego**
- I'm working on **physics/biology research** with Dr. Wouter-Jan Rappel at UCSD in the Rappel Lab, modeling cell motility (aggregative multicellularity) by leveraging **computer vision**/object detection to vectorize eukaryotic/amoebic behavior under starvation
- I'm also working at MixLab UCSD HDSI on **ML**-related projects, ranging from LLM Behavioral Research to Rediscovery Agents
- I've led ML research on **mechanistic interpretability** of pivotal tokens to predict **CoT reasoning shifts in LLMs** (w/ Cole Blondin & Sean O'Brien, EMNLP 2025), and benchmarked **SOTA MLLMs and VLMs** on novel **multimodal spatial reasoning** and planning tasks (AAAI 2026)
- I enjoy building AI-powered applications, exploring ML research, and working on B2B products for startups, particularly those that solve impactful real-world problems in **policy, healthcare, finance, etc.**
